<div id="services"><p> I have X years of experience volunteering to perform mock interviews and review resumes with x population. 
Many of my friends and family request my consultation when they have an upcoming interview or are looking to change careers.
In this economy, it is more important than ever to be prepared in order to land the job of your dreams. I would love to help you 
achieve the career you desire.  My fees are extremely modest because I do not want to add any more stress that comes with 
changing careers or landing that first job. Please contact me at dewarrenklangley@gmail.com with any questions or for more information. </p>
