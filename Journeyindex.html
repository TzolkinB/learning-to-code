<h1>My Journey in Web Development</h1>

<p>This is not much but it is a major accomplishment!</p>

<p> I also learned how to make a button on 
<span> <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy!</a> </span>
<p> Positioning is definitely a challenge. I want the button to be in line with the text. Just learned an important difference: span is in-line and div is block!So I just change the button from &lt;div> to &lt;span>.</span>
<p>Now I have moved my files to Text Wrangler and have new things to learn! For instance, I don't want to scroll to see the text so I will have to see how to wrap the text in the window. I've also been thinking that I need a motivator or reminder to keep me on track.</P>
<h3>Why do I Want to learn to Code?</h3><br />
 I want to make enough money to have the option of being a foster parent. I am becoming proficient with HTML & CSS but have not even started Javascript.
